## [VC01] Primary Color Selection

| Story | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | When this view controller loads, it should have one collection view, so that it can display the primary material colors to pick from |
| 2 | When I tap on one of the primary colors, the navigation bar should take its color, so that the user can get a feel of what that color would look like |
| 3 | When I tap on one of the primary colors, the navigation and status bar’s text should take on the associated text color, so that they are visible over the navigation bar’s new color |
| 4 | When I tap on one of the primary colors, every color but the one selected should be greyed out, so that I can clearly see what that color would look like |
| 5 | When I tap on one of the primary colors, the labels for each of the colors should appear (including the selected one), so that I can tell which color is which when selecting a new one |
| 6 | When I tap on one of the primary colors, the chosen color’s text should take on the associated text value for that color, so that it is clearly visible over the color |
| 7 | When I have already chosen a primary color and tap on it again, the UI should return to its initial state, so that I have a way of seeing the initial colors again |
| 8 | When I have already chosen a primary color and tap on another one, the UI should change similarly to when I had initially chosen that primary color, so that I am able to switch colors without reseting the UI |
